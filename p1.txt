turnin code:  cs_p1


Write a C program that takes a single command-line argument.

If the argument is
    -hw
you should simply print
    hello world
and then exit(0).

Otherwise, treat the command-line argument as a filename.  Your program
should produce the same output as the xxd program if it were given that 
same filename as its single command-line arg.

A sample test would look like this:

    ./p1 some_filename

and would produce the same output as this:

    xxd some_filename


Note that the C function isprint(3) could prove quite useful here.


Also note, that the language used by the textbook and in this class
are C without the C++ extensions.


To test the project, it will be run like this:
    ./p1 filename    ##  I may do this for multiple filenames


TURNIN info:
    You should submit a tar file of a directory which contains all of the
    required files (makefile, C source files, header files, etc).
    Sample tar command to create a tar file from a dir:
	tar cvf p1.tar ./p1dir  ## do *NOT* use full pathname of the dir
    Sample un-tar, build, and simple execution will be provided in a script
    in p1testfiles/PREP.
